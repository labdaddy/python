##### Object oriented programming
FROM Linux Basics for Hackers:

In object oriented programming the main component is the object which has properties (in the form of attributes and states) as well as methods (in the form of actions).
The idea behind OOP based programming languages is to create objects that act like things in the real world. For example, a car is an object that has properties, which are actions that the car takes, such as accelerating and locking the doors. 
From the perspective of natural language, an object is a noun, a property is an adjective and a method is a verb.
Objects ar members if a class, which is basically a template for creating objects with shared initial variables, properties and methods. For instance, say we had a class called cars, our car (a BMW) would be a member of the class cars. This class would also include other objects/ cars such as Mercedes and Audi.

Classes can also have subclasses. Lets say our car class has a BMW subclass and an object of that subclass might be the model 320i. Each object would have properties (make, model, year, color) an methods (start, drive, park).
In OOP languages objects inherit the characteristics of their class so the BMW 320i would inherit the start, drive and park methods of the car class.
